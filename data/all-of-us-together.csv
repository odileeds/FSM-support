Bradwell cares and other volunteers are going to be making up packed lunches to be picked up from outside the Memorial Hall. Obviously it would help if we had an idea of numbers but it’s not compulsory. If you would like the lunches and also if you have any dietary requirements please either private message me or text me on 07893244869. They will be ready to pick up hopefully from around 11.30 each day. Due to COVID regulations we will be serving outside and social distancing will apply. Sandwiches will be ham, cheese or tuna. There will also be a piece of cake a piece of fruit and a fruit juice as well. We look forward to seeing you all!!"
