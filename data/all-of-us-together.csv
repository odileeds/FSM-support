  Me and the boys at the @one2onedietwithamyandsteve believe that no child should ever go hungry, especially during a pandemic. 
  
  After the recent announcement of no free meals for children this half term, we would love to help any child that needs a hot meal or snacks... 
  
  We have~
  🍴Potato chilli with wedges
  🍴Beef kofta curry
  🍴Giant couscous 
  🍴Pearl Barley Risotto 
  🍴Beef Casserole
  
  And for snacks we have a range of flavoured Fava Beans 🥜
  
  To pick up your free meals and snacks, please call Amy on 07713277401 to arrange collection until 6pm each day this half term.

  Following the governments decision to no longer supply children with free meals over the school holidays,we have decided to do something to help our community.
  Here at Sally's Market Cafe we will be providing each child who is entitled to free school meals a hot meal from Tuesday 27th to Friday 30th during the half term, 10:00am - 1:00pm. We want to be sure no child ever goes hungry.
  We ask that children are accompanied by an adult.
  Any donations left over after the half term week or on the 'Pay with a Post-It' board will be carried over to the following Saturday. 
  
  Your children will have the choice of:
  
  Sausage, chips and beans.
  Fish fingers chips and beans.
  Chicken nuggets chips and beans.
  Vegaterian/vegan sausage and chicken nuggets with also be available.
  A piece of fruit and a glass of squash will also be included.
  The meals will be completely free and nothing else will need to be purchased along side this to qualify.
  
  If anyone would like to support the cause there are a number of ways you can donate...
  
  Messaging our Facebook Page or text/call 07870885914
  There will be a 'Pay with a Post-It' board in the cafe.
  Or you can donate through our 'Go Fund Me' link : https://www.gofundme.com/f/end-child-food-poverty?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_campaign=p_cf+share-flow-1

  Bradwell cares and other volunteers are going to be making up packed lunches to be picked up from outside the Memorial Hall. Obviously it would help if we had an idea of numbers but it’s not compulsory. If you would like the lunches and also if you have any dietary requirements please either private message me or text me on 07893244869. They will be ready to pick up hopefully from around 11.30 each day. Due to COVID regulations we will be serving outside and social distancing will apply. 
  Sandwiches will be ham, cheese or tuna. There will also be a piece of cake a piece of fruit and a fruit juice as well.

  Email us on info@wellingtonatwelwyn.co.uk in the morning (Monday to Friday next week) and choose from Sausages, Fish or vegetarian pasta, that will come with a lovely brownie bite, fresh fruit and a carton of juice.
  Collection will be between 12-1pm from the restaurant.

  We will do our best to help as many families as we can but as a small local restaurant we may not be able to cater for everyone everyday. We will respond to your requests before midday with a specific time for collection.

  Our faith is on you to be honest and responsible, please remember there are families out there who really are in need.
