Both our founders benefited from them as children and both experienced hunger when that safety net was not available. 
 
 Next week, we are offering up to 250 free meals for local children who need them (eat in or take away) and to help families have a half term treat, their parents or carers can pay just 50% for their own food and eat out as a family for as little as £4 in total. 
 
 Choice of a cheeze and tomato sandwich, with a banana and a packet of crisps plus a glass of fresh orange or apple juice (available to eat in or take-away) or a kid's burger and fries with a glass of apple or orange juice to eat in.
 
 Both options are 100% vegan. 
 
 Available from 10am until 3pm Tuesday 27th to Friday 30th October.","Ask for it on arrival, or ask for the family meal deal if adults would like 50% offer.","","https://www.facebook.com/297281256998607/posts/3611741948885838/","","","",""

 Following the governments decision to no longer supply children with free meals over the school holidays,we have decided to do something to help our community.
 Here at Sally's Market Cafe we will be providing each child who is entitled to free school meals a hot meal from Tuesday 27th to Friday 30th during the half term, 10:00am - 1:00pm. We want to be sure no child ever goes hungry.
 We ask that children are accompanied by an adult.
 Any donations left over after the half term week or on the 'Pay with a Post-It' board will be carried over to the following Saturday. 
 
 Your children will have the choice of:
 
 Sausage, chips and beans.
 Fish fingers chips and beans.
 Chicken nuggets chips and beans.
 Vegaterian/vegan sausage and chicken nuggets with also be available.
 A piece of fruit and a glass of squash will also be included.
 The meals will be completely free and nothing else will need to be purchased along side this to qualify.
 
 If anyone would like to support the cause there are a number of ways you can donate...
 
 Messaging our Facebook Page or text/call 07870885914
 There will be a 'Pay with a Post-It' board in the cafe.
 Or you can donate through our 'Go Fund Me' link : https://www.gofundme.com/f/end-child-food-poverty?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_campaign=p_cf+share-flow-1

 Me and the boys at the @one2onedietwithamyandsteve believe that no child should ever go hungry, especially during a pandemic. 
 
 After the recent announcement of no free meals for children this half term, we would love to help any child that needs a hot meal or snacks... 
 
 We have~
 🍴Potato chilli with wedges
 🍴Beef kofta curry
 🍴Giant couscous 
 🍴Pearl Barley Risotto 
 🍴Beef Casserole
 
 And for snacks we have a range of flavoured Fava Beans 🥜
 
 To pick up your free meals and snacks, please call Amy on 07713277401 to arrange collection until 6pm each day this half term.

 With the extremely generous supplies from the Bakehouse and the money already raised at the coop we are going to provide a packed lunch for every child in the village. 
 Bradwell cares and other volunteers are going to be making up packed lunches to be picked up from outside the Memorial Hall. Obviously it would help if we had an idea of numbers but it’s not compulsory. If you would like the lunches and also if you have any dietary requirements please either private message me or text me on 07893244869. They will be ready to pick up hopefully from around 11.30 each day. Due to COVID regulations we will be serving outside and social distancing will apply. 
 Sandwiches will be ham, cheese or tuna. There will also be a piece of cake a piece of fruit and a fruit juice as well.

 With the extremely generous supplies from the Bakehouse and the money already raised at the coop we are going to provide a packed lunch for every child in the village. 
 Bradwell cares and other volunteers are going to be making up packed lunches to be picked up from outside the Memorial Hall. Obviously it would help if we had an idea of numbers but it’s not compulsory. If you would like the lunches and also if you have any dietary requirements please either private message me or text me on 07893244869. They will be ready to pick up hopefully from around 11.30 each day. Due to COVID regulations we will be serving outside and social distancing will apply. 
 Sandwiches will be ham, cheese or tuna. There will also be a piece of cake a piece of fruit and a fruit juice as well. 
 We look forward to seeing you all!!","contact Sharon (phone number above) or any of the 'Bradwell Cares' volunteers","","https://www.facebook.com/groups/258007812289241","","","",""
