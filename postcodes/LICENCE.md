# Data Licence

The postcodes and coordinates within these sub-directories are from [the Office of National Statistics Postcode Lookup August 2020](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/national-statistics-postcode-lookup-august-2020). They are released by ONS under the OGL apart from Northern Ireland (`BT` postcodes) so that is not included here.

## ONS Licensing

If you are reproducing ONS content you must include a source accreditation to ONS.

We create a number of products that include the intellectual property rights (IPR) of other organisations; you should be aware of third-party rights and any need for licences. In these cases you should use the appropriate attribution/copyright statement(s).

### Postcode products (including postcode lookups)

Our postcode products (derived from Code-Point® Open) are subject to the Open Government Licence.

If you also use the Northern Ireland data (postcodes starting with “BT”), you need a separate licence for commercial use direct from Land and Property Services. We only issue a Northern Ireland End User Licence (for internal business use only) with the data. To download a copy, go to the “Download” section of this page. Use of the Northern Ireland data contained within the ONS postcode products constitutes acceptance of the Northern Ireland licensing terms and conditions.
